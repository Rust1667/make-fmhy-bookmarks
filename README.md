This repository is programmed to automatically generate browser bookmarks for the link collection FMHY.
It is auto-updated weekly with the new changes in the FMHY wiki.
Bookmarks are generated as HTML files which can be imported into any web browser.

### Why?
Web browsers have auto-complete and search functions that are based on bookmarked pages, so its helpful to have interesting sites bookmarked, so you can find them quicker and make sure you are on the right URL.

### How does it look once imported?
